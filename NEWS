Changes in camtrapR 0.99.1
=======================

bugfixes
------------
- detectionHistory and spatialDetectionHistory did not run correctly under some rare circumstances (combinations of input arguments)
- column names of detection histories were incorrect if occasionStartTime != 0 and datesAsOccasionNames = TRUE
- argument maxNumberDays in detectionHistory / spatialDetectionHistory works on each station individually if day1 = "survey" or "station"; and from the specified date if day1 is a date

other changes
------------
- additional checks for consistency of input in a number of functions
- code simplification invisible to the user


Changes in camtrapR 0.99.0
=======================

new functions
------------

  o checkSpeciesNames: checks a vector of species names (common or scientific) against the ITIS database via package 'taxize'
  o checkSpeciesIdentification: expanded from former function checkSpeciesFolders (now defunct). Can check identification if metadata tags were used for species identification. 
  o createStationFolders: Create camera trap station directories, possibly with camera subdirectories, for storing raw images (was not included in NAMESPACE of version 0.98.0, therefore invisible. Thanks to Patrick Lorch and Brent Pease for notification)
  
renamed functions
------------

  o recordDatabase           -> recordTable
  o recordDatabaseIndividual -> recordTableIndividual
  
  
renamed data sets
------------

  o recordDatabaseSample           -> recordTableSample
  o recordDatabaseIndividualSample -> recordTableIndividualSample
  
  
new features
------------

  o detectionHistory and spatialDetectionHistory: 
	- detection histories can begin on any specified date, station-specific setup date or day the first station was set up (to that end argument "beginWithDay1" was changed to "day1")
	- a buffer between setup and the first occasion can be applied (argument 'buffer').
  o spatialDetectionHistory: 
	- output can be given as counts or binary (argument "output")
	- an RMark data frame can be created using argument makeRMarkInput
  o extended support for identification via metadata tags (in functions appendSpeciesNames, getSpeciesImages)
  o exifTagNames: can return metadata, not only metadata tag names (new argument "returnMetadata")
  o createStationFolders: new argument "createinDir".
  o detecionMaps: new argument "speciesToShow" to make maps for certain species only
  o activity plot functions show number of records that were used
  
bugfixes
------------  
  
  o surveyReport returned an error when there were stations without records.
  o detecionMaps: Xcol and Ycol have arbitrary names now.
  
other changes
------------

  o arguments "customMetadataTags" and hasSpeciesFolders/ hasIndividualFolders was removed and replaced with argument "IDfrom"
  o metadata tags assigned in image management software are always extracted and tabulated in recordTable functions (making argument "customMetadataTags" obsolete)
  o some functions changed the user's working directory. Fixed. Thanks to Patrick Lorch for notification.
  o argument "hasCameraSubfolders" was renamed to "hasCameraFolders" (functions appendSpeciesNames, checkSpeciesIdentification, createSpeciesFolders, imageRename, timeShiftImages)
  o in all 4 activity plot functions, argument "all.species" was renamed to "allSpecies"
  o argument "recordTable" in spatialDetectionHistory was renamed to "recordTableIndividual" to make the difference from "recordTable" in "detectionHistory" clearer


  
Changes in camtrapR 0.98.0
=======================

new functions
------------

  o createStationFolders: Create camera trap station directories, possibly with camera subdirectories, for storing raw images
  o recordDatabaseIndividual: Single-species record databases from camera trap images with custom metadata tags
  o spatialDetectionHistory: prepare a capthist object for spatial capture-recapture analyses

new features
------------

  o support for camera subdirectories in species identification: Station/Camera/Species in the following function:
      - appendSpeciesFolders
      - createSpeciesFolders
      - checkSpeciesFolders
      - createStationFolders
      - getSpeciesImages
      - imageRename
      - recordDatabase
      - recordDatabaseIndividual
  o recordDatabase: can handle different types of directory structures and metadata tags (both custom and manufacturer-specific) and has gained new arguments: 
      - hasSpeciesFolders
      - cameraID (expanded from includeCameras)
      - camerasIndependent
      - stationCol
      - customMetadataTags
      - metadataHierarchyDelimitor
      - metadataSpeciesTag
      - additionalMetadataTags (renamed from metadataTags)
  o detectionMaps: shapefile export using packages sp and rgdal
  o checkSpeciesFolders: new argument stationsToCheck
  
other changes
------------

o checkSpeciesFolders: renamed argument exclude -> excludeSpecies
o detectionHistory: "session" in argument names was renamed to "occasion" (to be consistent with secr nomenclature)
o getSpeciesImages: removed argument emptyOutDir (nothing can be deleted anymore)
o recordDatabase: row names of object are 1:nrow


Changes in camtrapR 0.97.1
=======================

  o surveyReport: fixed bug which caused wrong numbers of active trap nights to be returned
  o surveyReport: does not depend on function cameraOperation anymore
  o renamed function TimeShiftImages to timeShiftImages
  o minor fixes in cameraOperation
  o some rephrasing in help files
  o changes to author list
